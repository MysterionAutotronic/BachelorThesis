  abstract = {Google's Borg system is a cluster manager that runs hundreds of thousands of jobs, from many thousands of different applications, across a number of clusters each with up to tens of thousands of machines.It achieves high utilization by combining admission control, efficient task-packing, over-commitment, and machine sharing with process-level performance isolation. It supports high-availability applications with runtime features that minimize fault-recovery time, and scheduling policies that reduce the probability of correlated failures. Borg simplifies life for its users by offering a declarative job specification language, name service integration, real-time job monitoring, and tools to analyze and simulate system behavior.We present a summary of the Borg system architecture and features, important design decisions, a quantitative analysis of some of its policy decisions, and a qualitative examination of lessons learned from a decade of operational experience with it.},

  abstract = {Continuous integration enables the development of microservices-based applications using container virtualization technology. Container orchestration systems such as Kubernetes, which has become the de facto standard, simplify the deployment of container-based applications. However, developing efficient and well-defined orchestration systems is a challenge. This article focuses specifically on the scheduler, a key orchestrator task that assigns physical resources to containers. Scheduling approaches are designed based on different Quality of Service (QoS) parameters to provide limited response time, efficient energy consumption, better resource utilization, and other things. This article aims to establish insight knowledge into Kubernetes scheduling, find the main gaps, and thus guide future research in the area. Therefore, we conduct a study of empirical research on Kubernetes scheduling techniques and present a new taxonomy for Kubernetes scheduling. The challenges, future direction, and research opportunities are also discussed.},
